# RIDGEFREQ - Calculates a ridge frequency image
#
# Function to estimate the fingerprint ridge frequency across a
# fingerprint image. This is done by considering blocks of the image and
# determining a ridgecount within each block by a call to FREQEST.
#
# Usage:
#  [freqim, medianfreq] =  ridgefreq(im, mask, orientim, blksze, windsze, ...
#                                    minWaveLength, maxWaveLength)
#
# Arguments:
#         im       - Image to be processed.
#         mask     - Mask defining ridge regions (obtained from RIDGESEGMENT)
#         orientim - Ridge orientation image (obtained from RIDGORIENT)
#         blksze   - Size of image block to use (say 32) 
#         windsze  - Window length used to identify peaks. This should be
#                    an odd integer, say 3 or 5.
#         minWaveLength,  maxWaveLength - Minimum and maximum ridge
#                     wavelengths, in pixels, considered acceptable.
# 
# Returns:
#         freqim     - An image  the same size as im with  values set to
#                      the estimated ridge spatial frequency within each
#                      image block.  If a  ridge frequency cannot be
#                      found within a block, or cannot be found within the
#                      limits set by min and max Wavlength freqim is set
#                      to zeros within that block.
#         medianfreq - Median frequency value evaluated over all the
#                      valid regions of the image.
#
# Suggested parameters for a 500dpi fingerprint image
#   [freqim, medianfreq] = ridgefreq(im,orientim, 32, 5, 5, 15);
