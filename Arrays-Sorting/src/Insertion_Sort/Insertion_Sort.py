#Description
#We can use binary search to reduce the number of comparisons in normal insertion sort.
#Binary Insertion Sort find use binary search to find the proper location to insert the selected item at each iteration.
# Insertion sort is used when number of elements is small. 
#It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.
