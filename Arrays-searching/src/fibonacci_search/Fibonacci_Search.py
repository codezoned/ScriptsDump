#Made by SHASHANK CHAKRAWARTY
# Python3 program for Fibonacci search.
'''
Works for sorted arrays
A Divide and Conquer Algorithm.
Has Log n time complexity.

1)Fibonacci Search divides given array in unequal parts

'''

#Given a sorted array arr[] of size n and an element x to be searched in it. Return index of x if it is present in array else return -1.
